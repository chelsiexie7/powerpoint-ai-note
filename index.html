    <h1>Rethinking AI’s Role in PowerPoint</h1>

      <h2>1. AI Should Support <em>How</em> We Tell Stories — Not <em>What</em> to Say</h2>
      <p>The real power of PowerPoint lies not in writing for the speaker, but in enhancing <strong>how ideas are structured, paced, visualized, and emotionally delivered</strong>. Storytelling isn’t just about assembling facts — it’s about rhythm, contrast, and human connection.</p>
      <p>AI should act as a <strong>narrative orchestrator</strong>, adapting visuals, motion, and language to support the speaker’s intent and delivery style.</p>

      <h2>2. Scenario-Based Storytelling: Features, Workflows, and Intent</h2>
      <p>"Scenario-based" doesn’t stop at templates — it drives <strong>feature logic and user experience</strong>. Tools like PDF-to-slide parsing, auto-report generators, and pitch structuring assistants only make sense when built for specific user contexts.</p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Scenario</th><th>Feature Evolution</th><th>Purpose</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Professors / Researchers</td>
            <td>PDF import + semantic slide chunking</td>
            <td>Convert dense research into teachable sequences</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Corporate Workers</td>
            <td>Word/chat/calendar ingestion → summary decks</td>
            <td>Highlight key outcomes and KPIs</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Consultants / PMs</td>
            <td>Cross-file merge + pitch structure automation</td>
            <td>Turn disjointed assets into narrative proposals</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Public Speakers</td>
            <td>Cinematic pacing + emotional cueing</td>
            <td>Create immersive, performance-ready experiences</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>3. Presentation as Interactive Performance</h2>
      <p>PowerPoint can evolve into a <strong>cinematic expression engine</strong> — supporting dynamic camera movements, gesture-triggered animations, and atmosphere-aware pacing. Think: TED Talk meets After Effects, but live and adaptive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Camerawork logic:</strong> zooms, pans, elevating shifts</li>
        <li><strong>Sound cues:</strong> emotional transitions, ambiance</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time gestures:</strong> voice- or body-driven sequencing</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback awareness:</strong> adapt pacing to audience response</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The next frontier of PowerPoint AI isn’t content mass production. It’s <strong>contextual, role-aware, storytelling-driven assistance</strong>. It’s co-creating — not replacing.</p>
